🧩 RAG System Evaluation Summary
📘 Overall Summary Judgment

The RAG system demonstrates strong factual accuracy and completeness when handling both PDF- and GitHub-based queries. However, it shows moderate issues with source attribution, particularly in questions requiring mixed-source reasoning.
Responses are typically detailed and technically correct, though occasionally more verbose than necessary.

📊 Evaluation Metrics
1. Content Accuracy – 9.0 / 10

Reasoning:
Across most test cases, the answers were semantically correct and frequently expanded with useful context.
Minor deviations appeared in multi-source or web-based questions, but overall factual precision remained high.

2. Completeness – 8.8 / 10

Reasoning:
The system generally covered all key points expected in the answers.
Occasionally, it went beyond scope or introduced small misalignments when dealing with multiple sources, but the coverage depth was consistently strong.

3. Source Attribution Accuracy – 7.0 / 10

Reasoning:
Attribution was accurate for single-source answers (PDF-only or GitHub-only).
However, when multiple sources were involved, the model tended to overweight one source and ignore minor contributions, leading to partial mismatches in expected ratios.

4. Conciseness – 8.0 / 10

Reasoning:
Most answers were clear and logically structured, though slightly verbose.
The responses favored explanation over brevity, maintaining readability but sometimes reducing succinctness.

🧮 Final Average Score

Overall Performance: 8.2 / 10

✅ Excellent in content accuracy and completeness, fair in conciseness, but needs improvement in fine-grained source attribution across multi-origin questions.
